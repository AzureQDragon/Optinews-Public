# Optinews

# What it does
Full stack web application that filters news articles semantically to find positive articles. We were inspired by the constant flood of bad news that leads to people becoming less involved with current events and not staying up to date with current events. The app is designed to help people stay more involved with current events and news.

# Tech Stack
React.js for frontend and Python Flask for backend api calls and tagging.

# Challenges
We ran into some problems with scraping news articles, but we were able to resolve this by using News API. The main problem we ran into dealt with proper semantic analysis of news articles. The current library we use is somewhat limited in its ability to detect sarcasm as well as some commonly used phrases that denote something negative, but the library detects as positive.
