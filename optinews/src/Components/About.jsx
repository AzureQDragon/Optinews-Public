                <h1>Who are we?</h1>
                <p>We are a group of students who are tired of witnessing the constant circulation of misinformation and negative news. While it is important to stay informed on all kinds of news, we observe that excessive consumption of bleak and depressing information can be more harmful than helpful. We hope that OptiNews can supplement regular news intake and encourage people to stay aware of what is happening in the world.</p>

                <p>Misinformation spreads rapidly on the internet and we want no part in that. We display news from a number of reliable sources to ensure that information is factually accurate.</p>
